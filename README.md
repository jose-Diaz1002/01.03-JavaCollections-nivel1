**Statement:**  
Create a class named `Month` with an attribute `"name"` (which will store the name of the month of the year).  
Add 11 `Month` objects (each with a different attribute) to an `ArrayList`, except for the object with the attribute `"Agost"`.  
Then, insert it in the correct position corresponding to this month and demonstrate that the `ArrayList` maintains the correct order.  

Convert the `ArrayList` from the previous exercise into a `HashSet` and ensure that it does not allow duplicates.  
Traverse the list using both a `for` loop and an iterator.  

**Technologies Used:**  
Java, IntelliJ IDEA
